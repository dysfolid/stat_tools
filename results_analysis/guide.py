    st.markdown("""
    Results Analysis helps you **analyze treatment effects** from your A/B test by comparing metrics between groups,
    calculating uplifts, and assessing statistical significance. The tool provides four analysis methods:

    - **Basic Analysis:** Direct comparison of metrics between groups
    - **CUPED Analysis:** Variance reduction using pre-experiment data to improve precision
    - **Difference-in-Differences (DiD):** Compares changes between groups across pre/post periods
    - **Heterogeneity Analysis:** Per-user treatment effects (CATE) via meta-learners — answers "for *whom* does the treatment work?"
    
    **When to Use:** After running your A/B test, upload the results data to analyze treatment effects, 
    calculate uplifts, and determine statistical significance.

    **Location:** 📤 Data Upload tab
    
    - Upload a CSV file containing your experiment results, OR
    - Click "🎲 Load Dummy Data" to use sample data for testing
    - The data should contain:
      - **Group column:** Column with group assignments (e.g., "control", "treatment")
      - **Metric columns:** Numeric columns with outcome metrics (e.g., revenue, conversion_rate, customer_churned)
      - **Pre/post columns (for CUPED/DiD):** Columns with pre-experiment and post-experiment values (e.g., revenue_pre, revenue_post)
    - ID columns (all unique values) are automatically excluded

    st.subheader("Step 2: Configure Group Column")
    st.markdown("""
    **Location:** ⚙️ Configuration tab
    
    1. **Select Group Column:**
       - Choose the column containing your group assignments
       - The tool will detect all unique groups
       - Group sizes and statistics will be displayed
    
    2. **Review Group Information:**
       - Check that groups are correctly identified
       - Verify group sizes look reasonable
       - Ensure you have at least 2 groups for analysis

    3. **Pre/Post Period Configuration (shared by CUPED & DiD):**
       - **Post-period suffix** (e.g. `_post`) — identifies post-experiment columns.
       - **Pre-period suffix #1** (e.g. `_pre`) — identifies the pre-experiment column.
       - **Checkbox: "My data has multiple pre-periods"** — when enabled, you can add more pre-suffixes (e.g. `_pre_w1`, `_pre_w2`, `_pre_w3`) with the ➕ button, and remove any with ✕.
       - Multi-pre mode automatically switches CUPED to a multivariate OLS adjustment (a.k.a. **CUPED+**) and DiD to an averaged-baseline + parallel-trends visualisation.

    4. **T-Test Type (optional):**
       - Default is **two-sided** (H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂) — recommended for most experiments
       - **Larger** (H₁: μ₁ > μ₂) and **Smaller** (H₁: μ₁ < μ₂) are one-sided tests
       - Applies to p-values shown in Basic, CUPED, and DiD analyses
       - Use one-sided only if your experiment was pre-registered as directional — switching to one-sided after seeing results inflates the false-positive rate

    # Tips and Best Practices
    st.header("💡 Tips & Best Practices")
    
    st.markdown("""
    **When to Use Each Analysis Method:**
    - **Basic Analysis:** Use for binary outcomes (e.g., customer_churned, new_customer), simple metrics, or when you don't have pre-experiment data
    - **CUPED Analysis:** Use when you have pre-experiment baseline data and want to reduce variance for more precise estimates. Particularly useful for continuous metrics.
    - **DiD Analysis:** Use when groups may have different baselines or when you want to account for pre-existing trends. Good for understanding relative changes.
    
    **Data Requirements:**
    - **Basic Analysis:** Requires only post-experiment metric columns
    - **CUPED/DiD:** Require both pre and post columns with matching suffixes (e.g., revenue_pre, revenue_post)
    - Column naming: Use consistent suffixes (default: "_pre" and "_post")
    - ID columns are automatically excluded
    
    **Metric Selection:**
    - Select all metrics that are relevant to your experiment
    - For CUPED/DiD, only metrics with both pre and post versions will be available
    - Binary metrics (0-1) work well with Basic Analysis
    - Continuous metrics benefit from CUPED adjustment
    
    **Interpreting Results:**
    - **Uplift:** Positive = treatment is better, negative = control is better
    - **P-value < 0.05:** Statistically significant difference (reject null hypothesis)
    - **T-Test Type:** Two-sided p-values test for any difference; one-sided (larger/smaller) test only the chosen direction and roughly halve the p-value when the data points that way — only use one-sided if pre-registered
    - **SMD < 0.1:** Small standardized difference (good balance)
    - **SMD 0.1-0.25:** Moderate difference
    - **SMD > 0.25:** Large difference
    - **DiD Gap:** The treatment effect after accounting for pre-existing differences
    
    **CUPED Benefits:**
    - Reduces variance by using pre-experiment baseline
    - Can detect smaller effects with same sample size
    - Particularly effective when pre/post correlation is high
    - Improves statistical power

    **Multi-pre CUPED (CUPED+):**
    - Uses OLS to fit `Y = Σ θᵢ·Xᵢ + ε` on the pooled data, then adjusts: `Y_adj = Y − Σ θᵢ·(Xᵢ − mean(Xᵢ))`
    - **R²** = fraction of post-period variance explained by the combined pre-periods. Higher is better; 2–4 pre-windows typically captures most of the achievable variance reduction
    - **Coefficients (θᵢ)** = relative weight of each pre-period. A near-zero coefficient means that period adds little; consider removing it
    - Adjacent pre-periods are highly correlated, so the 3rd or 4th window often shows a small or negative coefficient — that is fine
    - Only valid when all pre-period columns are measured **before** treatment assignment

    **Heterogeneity Analysis (CATE):**
    - Estimates a **per-user treatment effect** (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) rather than a single ATE
    - Inputs: outcome (raw post column, or CUPED-adjusted post), treatment vs control levels, mixed-type features (numeric + categorical with per-column encoding choice)
    - Choose a **meta-learner**:
      - **T-learner**: separate outcome models for treated and control. Simple and robust; the right default unless you have a specific reason.
      - **S-learner**: single outcome model with treatment as a feature. Often *shrinks* effects toward zero — use cautiously.
      - **X-learner**: extends T-learner with a two-stage imputation step. Better when the arms have very different sizes.
      - **DR-learner**: doubly-robust — valid inference under either correct outcome OR correct propensity model. Slower.
      - **CausalForest**: nonparametric, automatically captures feature interactions; the most expressive option but the slowest.
    - Choose a **base ML model**: RandomForest (default), GradientBoosting, or Linear/Logistic.
    - Holdout split + Qini curve quantify whether the model's ranking of users by predicted CATE actually captures incremental value.
    - **AUUC** > 0 means the model's targeting beats random targeting; AUUC < 0 means it underperforms random (overfit or noisy data).
    - Subgroup drill-down lets you slice the predicted CATE by any categorical feature or numeric quintile — turns "the treatment lifts revenue +3%" into "the lift is +6% for East-region desktop users and −1% for South-region mobile users."

    **Multi-pre DiD (parallel-trends visualisation):**
    - Replaces the single pre-period bar with a **line plot** showing each group's mean at every pre-period and the post-period
    - The DiD parallel-trends assumption is satisfied when the lines for different groups stay roughly **parallel before** the post-period; divergent pre-trends invalidate the simple DiD estimate
    - Baseline for the DiD gap and p-value becomes the **row-wise mean** of all pre-period columns — less noisy than a single pre snapshot

    **DiD Benefits:**
    - Accounts for pre-existing differences between groups
    - Controls for time trends that affect both groups
    - Provides causal interpretation under parallel trends assumption
    - Good for observational studies or when randomization wasn't perfect
    
    **Workflow Tips:**
    - Start with Basic Analysis for quick overview
    - Use CUPED if you have baseline data and want more precision
    - Use DiD if groups had different baselines or you want to control for trends
    - Compare results across methods for robustness
    - Download summaries and plots for documentation
    - Save artifacts for reproducibility
